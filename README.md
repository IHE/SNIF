## Introduction to the Network Interfaces Form White Paper (SNIF)
Configuration management of peer interfaces enabling IHE profiles is burdensome within HDOs (Healthcare Delivery Organizations). Interfaces are often manually configured, requiring trained integrators to: gather configuration properties, configure and test interoperability. The human element introduces the opportunity for errors, often typographical, that can be difficult to identify and correct. The increasing adoption of secure connectivity protocols complicates connectivity by adding additional properties, such as logging and certificates. 

The Survey of Network Interfaces Form White Paper, ([SNIF](/SNIF-Whitepaper.md)) proposes a content profile that provides a consistent method to catalogue configuration properties for human and machine consumption during installation, upgrade and repair.

### Intended Audience: 
* IT departments of healthcare institutions
* Integrators, consultants and interface analysts
* Technical staff of vendors participating in the deployment and service of healthcare applications
